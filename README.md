📘 DevOps Zero to Hero

A complete journey from Day 1 --- because in DevOps, it's always Day 1.

Welcome to the DevOps Zero to Hero repository! This is my open and
transparent learning journey where I document everything I learn
from absolute basics to advanced concepts, real-world workflows, tools,
and full DevOps projects.

I made this repository public intentionally, because:

-   Learning in public builds discipline and consistency
-   It helps others who are starting their DevOps journey
-   Feedback from the community accelerates growth
-   Documenting knowledge makes you a stronger engineer
-   DevOps is all about collaboration --- this repo reflects that
    mindset

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced engineer brushing up your
fundamentals, I hope this journey inspires you to keep improving every
single day.

🚀 **Why "Day 1" Always?**

In DevOps, every day is Day 1.
This mindset reminds us that:

-   Learning never stops
-   There is always a better way to automate
-   Improvement is continuous
-   Curiosity matters more than experience
-   Progress \> Perfection

I start every session with the mindset of Day 1, and this repo captures
that spirit.

🌱 **Motivation for Learners**

If you're new to DevOps, remember:

-   Every expert was once a beginner
-   You don't need to know everything you just need to start
-   Consistency beats talent
-   The best way to learn DevOps is by doing
-   Build → Break → Fix → Improve
-   The community is always here to support you
-   Your progress matters more than your speed

This repo is not just documentation --- it's proof that learning in
public works.
