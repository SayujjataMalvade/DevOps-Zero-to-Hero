# DevOps Overview

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a collaborative culture aimed at improving software delivery
through automation, quality assurance, testing, and monitoring.\
As a DevOps Engineer, I focus on enhancing application delivery
pipelines by implementing automation, ensuring quality checks,
performing testing, and enabling efficient monitoring.

## Why DevOps?

DevOps was introduced to bridge the gap between development and
operations, reducing manual efforts and deployment delays.\
Before DevOps, separate roles such as System Administrator, Server
Administrator, and Build & Release Engineer often led to longer
deployment cycles.

DevOps streamlines these processes into a unified approach, enabling
faster, more reliable releases.

## About Me

As a DevOps Engineer, my day‑to‑day responsibilities include: -
Automating workflows
- Performing security scans
- Testing applications
- Monitoring system performance
- Managing Jira tickets to track tasks and ensure smooth delivery

This approach enables consistent, efficient, and scalable application
delivery across teams.
