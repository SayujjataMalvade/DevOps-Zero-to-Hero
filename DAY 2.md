What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a standardized process followed by organizations to ensure efficient and high-quality delivery of products to end users. It provides a structured framework for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.

Example:
Consider an e-commerce website (e.g., example.com) that currently has two sections: Male and Female. The owner decides to add a new Children section. The SDLC stages for implementing this change would be:

1.Planning & Requirements:

Define the goal — adding a Children section. Conduct research to understand customer demand, such as interest in different age groups. Planning is done based on these insights.

2.Definition:

Document detailed requirements, such as the specific age ranges (e.g., 1–4 years, 6–12 years). These documents guide development decisions.

3.Design:

Developers prepare both high-level and low-level designs.

High-Level Design (HLD): Overall system architecture, scalability planning (e.g., load balancers, auto-scaling, replica sets).

Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed implementation steps and component-specific design.

4.Testing:

The QA team tests the developed code to ensure it meets requirements and is bug-free. The tested code is stored in a distributed version control system (e.g., Git, GitHub).

5.Deployment:

Once approved, the application is deployed to the production server for end users.

DevOps in SDLC

A DevOps Engineer plays a key role in automating the Build, Test, and Deploy stages of the SDLC, ensuring faster, more reliable, and more efficient delivery of applications to end users.
