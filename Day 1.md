What is DevOps?

DevOps is a collaborative culture aimed at improving software delivery through automation, quality assurance, testing, and monitoring. As a DevOps Engineer, I focus on enhancing application delivery pipelines 
by implementing automation, ensuring quality checks, performing testing, and enabling efficient monitoring.

Why DevOps?

DevOps was introduced to bridge the gap between development and operations, reducing manual efforts and deployment delays. Previously, separate roles like System Administrator, Server Administrator, 
and Build & Release Engineer led to longer deployment cycles. DevOps streamlines these processes into a unified approach, enabling faster, more reliable releases.

About Me

As a DevOps Engineer, my day-to-day responsibilities include automating workflows, performing security scans, testing applications, and monitoring system performance. I also work on Jira tickets to manage and track tasks, ensuring smooth and efficient delivery of applications.
